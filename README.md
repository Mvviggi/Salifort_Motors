 ### Plan Stage
1. The main stakeholders are Salifortâ€™s senior leadership team and the Human Resources department.
2. Analyze the survey data taken by employees and come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. 
3. Employees from the Sales department were the most that took the survey out of 10 departments in the company.
4. Used Excel Pivot Table for a first glance of the data, and then used the dataset in Visual Studio Code for all EDA, Construct, and Execute phase.
5. Given this dataset was provided by Coursera and created for a fictional company, it can be assumed it reliability and originality.

#### Analyze Stage 
Summary of EDA performed:
1. Removed duplicates
2. Check for outliers: tenure column had 824 rows
3. The satisfactory level column ranges from 0.09 to 1.0.
4. The tenure column ranges from 2 to 10 years, with a median of 3 years.
5. Some columns had mix of upperclass letters which were all converted to lowercase. The column orginally called 'time_spend_company' was changed to 'tenure' for simple and concise name.
6. EDA process: <br>
    a. Get more understanding of employees staying vs leaving the company. <br>
    b. Create data visualizations to evaluate relationships between independent and dependent variables.
7. Results indicate that 16% of employees left while 83% of employees stayed at the company.

The heatmap above shows that the employees that left the company correlated negatively with satisfaction_level. Meanwhile, the number of projects, average monthly hours and  evaluation scores had a positive correlation with each other.
