    "1. The Decision Tree and Random Forest Models had two rounds of training and testing because after first round of results, feature engineering was considered in order to corroborate the test score high values. This was performed due to a possibility of data leakeage. It was suspected that the 'average_monthly_hours' might have been the source of the leakeage.\n",
    "    - The 'satisfaction_level' variable was removed for the second run.\n",
    "2. The second round of Decision Tree and Random Forest with one variable less, result with slightly lower test scores but good overall.\n",
    "3. Random Forest Model had the best overall test scores to predict whether an employee would leave the company. \n",
    "4. From the Confusion matrix, the best prediction model that best suited to answer the question is the XGBoost Model. \n",
    "     The test scores for the XGBoost are: <br>\n",
    "        accuracy score: 98% <br>\n",
    "        precision score: 97% <br>\n",
    "        recall score: 91% <br>\n",
    "        f1 score: 94%\n",
    "5. The reasons that employees are likely to leave the company is to be overworked which can be led due to having multiple projects and having a long tenure at the company, in addition to not having enough evaluation performance reviews. "

    "2. Results show that the range of average monthly hours is from 96 to 310 hours. Approximately monthly hours of working is 166.67 for an employee 50 weeks a year, 5 days a week for 8 hours per day. <br> It could be defined that overworking is > 175 hrs per month on average. <br>\n",
    "        - Employees could be more satisfied in the job if there is a more balanced work/life and have a limit of average mohtly hours worked.\n",
